[#prerequisite]
== Setup OpenShift Cluster
:profile: acs

To run OpenShift4, you need to have one provisioned environment using https://demo.redhat.com[RHPDS] - Go to Catalog -> Openshift 4.10 Workshop.

== Connect to your bastion server

Once you have a workshop environment, you need to access the bastion server in your environment via SSH.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
ssh lab-user@<YOUR_BASTION_SERVER>
----

Some CLI tools are already installed on you bastion server. You can check the OpenShift version using:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc version	
----

The output should show oc version >=4.10:	

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
Client Version: {ocp-version}
Server Version: {ocp-version}
Kubernetes Version: {kubernetes-version}
----

== Login OpenShift Web console

If you have a workshop environment, you can access OpenShift web console.

The web console URL is shown in RHPDS as well as cluster admin username/password.
